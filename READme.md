### `Vite`

Vite
Next Generation Frontend Tooling
Get ready for a development environment that can finally catch up with you.[Click Here for](https://vitejs.dev/) reading documentation.

### `My Experience`

Vite is super fast for developing modren applications of Javascript frameworks and libraries. I used it with React. Super Fast it is.

### `In src I have done all setup. You can add module in different directories inside components directory specifically.`

## Available Scripts

In the template directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command shall install your all dev and production dependencies\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser or maybe vite can provide any other port if vite project is already running on that port.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
